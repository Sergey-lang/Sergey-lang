### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Frontend Developer with a focus on Next.js and TypeScript.
4+ years of experience in developing web and mobile applications, ranging from EdTech platforms to e-commerce. I independently implement features from idea to production, participate in architectural design, and actively use FSD and modern frontend tools (RTK Query, Effector, React Hook Form, Tailwind, Vite, and more).

I am constantly evolving: studying application architecture and backend (Node.js). I am interested in UX and interface performance.
I have worked in large teams using Scrum/Kanban and have directly interacted with clients.

I use neural networks and AI tools in my work â€“ they help me generate ideas, accelerate development, and explore new technologies. I completed a course on using AI and neural network APIs for integration.
I have basic experience working with Vue 3, Pinia, VueRouter, Nuxt

I prefer remote work, but I am open to hybrid or office setups. I am also open to relocation if offered a strong opportunity.
